"nmta blog" is a blog written by Kosuke Nakamura. I am a software engineer and project manager. I'm interested in front-end technology and engineering management, but the last technology I created is jQuery.
Vue.js, Angular and React are all good. But I still like jQuery. Hmm ... that time was good. I'll concentrate on management from now on.
If you want to see the product I created, check GitHub.
